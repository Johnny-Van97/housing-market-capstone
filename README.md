# Nashville Housing Market 

This project examines Nashville’s housing market by analyzing home prices, mortgage and rent trends, inventory levels, and new construction. It also explores how population and income growth align with real estate patterns, offering a broader perspective on the region’s market shifts over time.

# Motivation

As a first time homebuyer living in Nashville and originally from northern California, I’ve personally experienced two considerably different real estate markets. California's housing market has become infamously expensive, while Nashville is a rapidly growing and seemingly more affordable alternative. However, Nashville has seen significant price increases in recent years. I would like to better understand how the Nashville real estate market looks in terms of affordability, price growth, and investment value.

# Questions

1) How does the Nashville housing market compare to the national housing market?
2) How has Nashville's population affected new homes being built and the pricing trends?
3) Is Nashville’s housing demand on a continuous uptrend?
4) How has Nashville’s rental market compared to the homeownership market?
5) How has the change in median income of Nashville’s population affected the housing market?

# Challenges

The majority of the data being used is from Zillow's housing data. This website has an abundance of detailed data that is oddly formatted and is overwhelming in its library size. Going through this library of data to select what I deemed was appropriate for this project was a project in itsself. The data is vast and can tell any number of different stories depending on approach. Many different data sets had to be brought in, cleaned, and joined since each data set had a very detailed but limited scope in terms of what stories I could extract out of it.


# Technologies Used

1) Python - for exploration and manipulation of the dataset
2) Excel - for further manipulation of data
3) Canva - for creating a slide deck to present
4) Git - for version control

# Conclusion
Nashville’s housing market has become increasingly imbalanced, with home prices surging 134% since 2015 while incomes have only grown 63%, creating widening affordability gaps. Owning a home is now around 60% more expensive than renting, and population growth of 26% since 2010 has only intensified demand. At the same time, new builds and overall housing supply have remained inconsistent, adding volatility to the market. Since 2016, Nashville has shifted from being slightly more affordable than the national average to significantly less affordable, with the gap widening sharply after 2021 as high prices, limited supply, and elevated interest rates have compounded the affordability challenge.
